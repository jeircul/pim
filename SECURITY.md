# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest tagged release and `main` branch receive security fixes on a best-effort basis. Older releases are not actively maintained.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Use the GitHub "Report a vulnerability" flow (Security -> Advisories -> Report) to share details privately with the maintainers.
- If that option is unavailable, open an issue tagged with `[SECURITY]` and include impact, reproduction steps, and affected scopes; we can convert it to a private discussion if needed.
- Avoid posting exploit details publicly until a fix or mitigation is available.

Thank you for helping keep the project safe.
